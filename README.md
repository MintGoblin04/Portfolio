# BBC Mircos:
>Snake Game
>> I coded this game when I visited the Nation Museum of Computing at Bletchy Park.
>> Here I learnt about the command line interface and programes a game on Snake on it.
>> It was difficult at first due to the fact I was use to the standard QWERTY keybaord but I soon overcame this.
>> It was a lot of fun to take part in and gave me an insight on how to use different user interfaces.

# Variables in the game:
>Mutli-Coloured line is the snake. Here is the character the user will be controlling and determines if the game stops. I could of chosen any colour but I thought a rainbow snake was more interesting to look at.

>Green line is the enemy so there was higher steaks in the game. By clashing with this line with the snake, the game stops and the user will have to restart the game to get a higher score.

>Red triangles. These are obstructions that range in size and appears all over the map sqaure (the red box). If the snake collide with these objects the game stops.

>Timer. In the bottom left corner, there is a count of the seconds played in the game. It allows for players to compare times and see who is the better gamer.
