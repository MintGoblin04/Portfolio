Created this to show my development in these areas. May be a bit bare because I am updating this repository over the year.
At the moment, I am focusing on Python as this is the main programming language my BTEC course uses.

>Dice Game
>>Turtle Race Game
>>>Pong Game

Visual Basic:
>Selection of text boxes

BBC Mircos:
>Snake Game

PowerShell:
>Sorting numbers from a file
